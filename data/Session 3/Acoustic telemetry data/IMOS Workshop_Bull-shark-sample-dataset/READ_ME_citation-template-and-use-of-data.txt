### RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE DOWNLOADED DATASETS:

Users of data collated by the IMOS Animal Tracking Facility are expected to exhibit professional courtesy and utilise these data within the bounds of the highest scientific integrity. 

When a proportion of the data used in a study are from acoustic receivers maintained by parties other than IMOS, or from transmitters deployed by other researchers, the IMOS Animal Tracking Facility asks data users to discuss details and expectations of the project with data owners, as well as authorship and acknowledgement on publications, prior to making use of the data.

In the case of the IMOS Animal Tracking Database, data refers to any transmitter or receiver metadata and detection data accessed through the Database Web-interface or via the AODN online portal. The relevant tag and receiver owners should therefore be contacted regarding data sharing and authorship discussions.

Contact information for Project Leaders (i.e. data owners) associated with each project are available on the Web-interface. The IMOS Animal Tracking Facility can help facilitate communication between investigators.


### ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMOS ANIMAL TRACKING DATABASE AND DATA CONTRIBUTORS:

Any use of datasets accessed via the IMOS Animal Tracking Database must include the following acknowledgement and citations, as appropriate.

In the Acknowledgements section:

Data was sourced from Australiaâ€™s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au). IMOS is enabled by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). It is operated by a consortium of institutions as an unincorporated joint venture, with the University of Tasmania as Lead Agent.
